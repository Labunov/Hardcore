They came flyin' from faraway
now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
they've seen places beyond my land
and they've found new horizons
they speak strangely but I understand
and I dream I'm an eagle
and I dream I can spread my wings
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Flyin' high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
high, high
what a feeling to fly
over mountains and forests and seas
and to go anywhere that I please
