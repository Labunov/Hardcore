They came flyin' from faraway
now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
they've seen places beyond my land
and they've found new horizons
they speak strangely but I understand
and I dream I'm an eagle
and I dream I can spread my wings
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Flyin' high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
high, high
what a feeling to fly
over mountains and forests and seas
and to go anywhere that I please


As all good friends we talk all night
and we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
there's no limit to what I feel
we climb higher and higher
am I dreamin' or is it all real
is it true I'm an eagle
is it true I can spread my wings


Flyin' high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
high, high
what a feeling to fly
over mountains and forests and seas
and to go anywhere that I please
